# ðŸŒ¦ React Weather App

This is a simple weather app I have developed using Create React App, TypeScript, Axios, Styled-Components and React Spring for light animations.

## ðŸš€ Running the application

1. `yarn` or `npm install` (once)
2. `yarn start` or `npm start`

In order to run this application you require an [Apixu API key](https://www.apixu.com/api.aspx).
